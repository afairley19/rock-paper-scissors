# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is my first JavaScript experience and is part of the [Odin Project's Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The JavaScript is embedded in an HTML file using the <script> tag. To play the game, you open the HTML file in a web browser A prompt will appear, advising you to submit your response ("rock," "paper," or "scissors"). You will then open the console to view what was selected by the computer and whether you won or lost.

This is incredibly rudimentary as it is my very first JavaScript project. I hope to improve functionality and design as I learn more about the language.
